# Weather-TM

This Weather app is for giving hourly and daily weather for a given postcode. We also want to give the user suggestions of postcodes to have fun and see the weather information for random postcodes within the UK. There is also 4 random cities selected every refresh, for fun :)

- [x] Input information to change the displayed result
- [ ] View the app on all of my devices


## Stretch stories

- [ ] As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong
